Implementation of differential RL algorithms for average-reward continuing tasks

The implementations are based on differential algorithms introduced in Sutton and Barto's "Reinforcement Learning: an introduction" (ch. 10.3, p. 249-255, 2018), and [Learning and Planning in Average-Reward Markov Decision Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.16318) by Yi Wan, Abhishek Naik, Richard S. Sutton.

Plotting script is based on [@abhisheknaik96](http://github.com/abhisheknaik96)'s own [script](https://github.com/abhisheknaik96/average-reward-methods/blob/master/learning_planning_exps.ipynb).
